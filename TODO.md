# TODOs

- add chm header-calls (like `vector<int>` in c++, java etc.)
- consider implementing class `HasDefault<Type>`, as in C it is allowed to have `main` return nothing and `0` (int's default value) is returned
- do CComplexReal and CComplexImag
- there is a problem with `main(void){}`
- look at why it doesn't parse C-structs when there are no instances given in the struct definition
- check superclasses when created user-defined instances of classes
- make generic instances work
- support default methods
